# Machine Learning Workflow - From EDA to Production

## Introduction

This repo tries to study & apply the least minimal steps involved in machine learning workflow the right way. It is compiled during the ["Machine Learning Zoomcamp"](https://datatalks.club/courses/2021-winter-ml-zoomcamp.html) course instructed by amazing [@alexeygrigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev).

## Problem Description

The problem we will study was held as a competition on Kaggle titled as ["Allstate Claims Severity"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/). The data was provided by ["Allstate"](https://www.allstate.com/), a personal insurer in the United States. They were looking for ML-based methods to reduce the cost of insurance claims.
The objective of the problem is to predict _'loss'_ value for a claim, which makes it a __regression__ problem. The submissions for test data are evaluated on the __Mean Absolute Error (MAE)__ between the predicted loss and the actual loss.
All the data column values and names in provided dataset are obfuscated for the privacy reasons. Thus, we'll have no __"Domain Knowledge"__ over this problem.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this repo is a __"Tabular"__ one, meaning the data is represented in __rows__ and __columns__, corresponding to __samples__ and __features__ respectively.<br>
Data columns (features) are in both __categorical__ and __numerical__ types. Train and test datasets contain __188,318__ and __125,546__ rows (samples) respectively with __130__ columns as features, plus two more columns representing "claim id" and "target" named as _'id'_ and _'loss'_.

Regarding the dataset's availability, it is already provided in repo's <mark>__scripts/data__</mark> folder and you don't need to download it separately.

## Requirements

This entire repo relies on python programming language for demonstrating a machine learning workflow. Workflow steps are explained and can be run in ["Jupyter Notebook"](https://jupyter.org) documents, allowing us to execute them in an interactive environment. The easiest way to install python and many popular libraries for data science is through setting up [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). You may refer to <mark>__virtual-env__</mark> folder in this repo to review a quick guide on how to setup a virtual environment without running into conflicts with your current setup.

I'd also recommend you to go through the notebooks one by one, and orderly.

## Important Note

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that __"Data Collection"__ step is already done since we're going to use a publicly available Kaggle dataset. Please note though, this is not the case in real-world scenarios. Most of the time, tabular data is collected by querying multiple database tables and running pretty complex SQL commands. If you're planning to become a machine learning engineer, make sure you understand and know a good deal about databases and writing efficient SQL queries; that, ladies and gents, turns out to be an essential & invaluable asset to possess for a ML engineer.

The main intention in this workflow is not achieving the best benchmark score for the subject dataset, and by no way it claims to contain the most complete sub-steps.

Given the above line you might ask, what's the focus here? I can summarize the answer with following lines:

- To take a quick look at the minimal required steps involved in a machine learning problem, from EDA to production.
- Trying to avoid common slips, and conducting each step the right way.

A good machine learning solution involves many steps; the ml algo for instance, is just tip of the iceberg. Hopefully, the material here gives you a nice view of what you should expect in your journey üòâ.
